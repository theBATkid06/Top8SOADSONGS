		<h2>Top 1 - Chop Suey!</h2>
		
		<h3>About This Song</h3>
		<h3>"Chop Suey!" is the first single from American heavy metal band System of a Down's second album Toxicity. 
		The single was released in August 13, 2001 and earned the band its first Grammy nomination in 2002 for Best Metal 
		Performance. "Chop Suey!" is often considered the band's signature song.</h3>
		
		<h3>In an interview, Daron Malakian explained, 
		"The song is about how we are regarded differently depending on how we pass. Everyone deserves to die. Like, if I 
		were now to die from drug abuse, they might say I deserved it because I abused dangerous drugs. Hence the line, 
		'I cry when angels deserve to die.'" The lyrics for the midsection ("Father into your hands I commend my spirit" ...) 
		were randomly picked out by Serj Tankian from Rick Rubin's book collection after Tankian was struggling for ideas. 
		Although it was not revealed what book the lines were taken from, they are quoted from the Sayings of Jesus on the cross 
		"Luke 23:46 and Mark 15:34." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chop_Suey!">Click to read more on Wikipedia.</a></h3>
