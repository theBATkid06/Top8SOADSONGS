		"All research and successful drug policies show that treatment should be increased/ And law enforcement decreased/ while abolishing mandatory minimum sentences," "Utilizing drugs to pay for secret wars 
		around the world/ Drugs are now your global policy now you police the globe... drug money is used to rig elections/ And train brutal corporate sponsored dictators/ Around the world" "Minor drug offenders 
		fill your prisons/You don't even flinch, all our taxes paying for your wars against the new non-rich..." <a href="https://soad.fandom.com/wiki/Prison_Song">Click to read more on System Of A Down Wiki.</a></h3>
