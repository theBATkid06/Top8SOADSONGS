		<h3>About This Song</h3>
		<h3>Suggestions released in System Of A Down's first ever Self-Titled album which came out in 1998.</h3>
		
		<h3>“Suggestions” talks about the media and how the authority treats you as nothing. The whole song is a metaphor 
		with the storyline of a ship that is being attacked by another battalion. <a href="https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-suggestions-lyrics">Click to read more on Genius.</a></h3>
