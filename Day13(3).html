		<h3>About This Song</h3>
		<h3>"Question!" is a song by American heavy metal band System of a Down, released in July 2005 as the second single
		from their fourth studio album Mezmerize.After the release of B.Y.O.B., the band were deciding what song to release 
		as a single. They eventually chose "Question!" after finding out radio stations had already been playing the track.</h3>
		
		<h3>Shavo Odadjian produced the video (and co-directed it alongside Howard Greenhalgh) after allegedly having an image 
		of the video in a nightmare, which consisted of a boy offering a girl berries, unaware that the berries were poisonous. 
		It is claimed that before the dream he did not intend to produce the video and did not want any special treatment over 
		other possible producers for being in the band, thus submitting the idea anonymously.The video was shot in the now-closed
		Los Angeles Theater, which opened in 1931. Tankian described the place, "It's an amazing old theater that is due for renovation. 
		I'm glad they haven't renovated it yet, because it has the right character for what we were looking for. It has a fairy tale vibe."
