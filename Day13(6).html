		<h2>Top 6 - Needles</h2>
		
		<h3>About This Song</h3>
		<h3>Needles is the second track on System of a Down's second album. The lyrics and music were written by Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian. 
		The track is about the dangers of using drugs. It's noticeable for using similar death growls as the Prison Song and using complex discordant 
		riffs during the verse breakdowns. <a href="https://soad.fandom.com/wiki/Needles">Click to read more on System Of A Down Wiki.</a></h3>
