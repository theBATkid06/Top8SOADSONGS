		<h3>About This Song</h3>
		<h3>"Chic 'n' Stu" or Pizza Pie is the opening track from the record titled Steal This Album! by System of a Down which came out in 2002. 
		It is a reference to sports broadcasters Chick Hearn and Stu Lantz, and the album version opens with a famous quote 
		often uttered by Hearn when a game's outcome was no longer in doubt. The concept for the song was conceived while 
		watching a Los Angeles Lakers game. The group noticed that the broadcast inundated with enticing advertisements, 
		particularly a pizza commercial which left them hungry. <a href="https://soad.fandom.com/wiki/Chic 'n' Stu">Click to read more on System Of A Down Wiki.</a></h3>
